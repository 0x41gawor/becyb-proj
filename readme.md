# BECYB - Endless SSH poc

## 1. Prepare the environment

I've just created the ubuntu server virtual machine in VirtualBox.

TODO rysunek architektury tego here

## 2. Change default OpenSSH port

The OpenSSH client is included in Ubuntu by default. And the default port is 22.

### 2.1 Check the current OpenSSH port

```sh
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep ssh
```

### 2.2 Open OpenSSH configuration file

```sh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### 2.3 Change the OpenSSH configuration file content

![](img/3.png)

Only one line requires the change. Uncomment the Port line and replace the default value with your desired one.

Save the file.

### 2.4 Restart the OpenSSH deamon

```sh
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### 2.5 Check the current OpenSSH port again

```sh
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep ssh
```

### 2.6 Final notes

Note that now you'll need to specify the port to connect to the machine, since the value is no longer the default one.

## 3. Install and run Endless SSH

### 3.1 Clone the github repo

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh.git
```

### 3.2 Build the binaries

You may need to install `make` or `gcc` first.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libc6-dev
cd ~/endlessh
make
```

### 3.3. Move the binary to your PATH folder

```sh
echo $PATH
cd ~/endlessh
sudo mv endlessh /usr/local/bin/
```

Check if it is there

```sh
which endlessh
```

### 3.4 Copy the endlessh.service file to the appriopriate dir

```sh
cd ~/endlessh
sudo cp util/endlessh.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

### 3.5 Enable systemctl endlessh service

```
sudo systemctl enable endlessh
```

### 3.6 Create the config file for endlessh

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/endlessh
sudo nano /etc/endlessh/config
```

You only need to specify the port.

### 3.7 Run the systemctl endlessh service

```sh
sudo systemctl start endlessh
```

Make sure the systemctl service is running:

```sh
sudo systemctl | grep endlessh
```

```sh
sudo systemctl status endlessh.service
```

Make sure its running on the correct port:

```sh
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep endlessh
```

### 3.8 Enable running on ports < 1024

Go to file and read the comment starting with line `## If you want Endlessh to bind on ports < 1024`

```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/endlessh.service
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/endlessh
sudo reboot
```

### 3.10 Check if the systemctl service is running

Make sure the systemctl service is running:

```sh
sudo systemctl | grep endlessh
```

```sh
sudo systemctl status endlessh.service
```

Make sure its running on the correct port:

```sh
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep endlessh
```

## 4. Test it out

### 4.1 First check the legit SSH connection on new port

### 4.2 Now try to connect with default port or no port specified

![](img/8.png)

As you can see the console stops and nothing is displayed. The program is stuck. Console does not give control back. As a human we can easily detect it and just stop our attempt with SIGNINT (ctrl+c), but for the automated script this is what we call the **SSH JAIL!!!**.

Lets see what under the hood with verbose option:

![](img/9.png)

We get this "ssh_exchange_identification" every 30 seconds (time interval can be configured).

Script kiddie trapped inside our SSH Jail can spent very long time before attacker figures it out. And remember that in cyber security every minute lost by the attacker is a minute gained by us.
